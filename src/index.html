            Hello operator! I am your deep space exporer unit, designation DSE-LD48, but you can call me DESIE for short!
            We've successfully located a wormhole on the ourskirts of this sector. Isn't that exciting?!
            <button type="button" class="js-proceed" data-next="mode">I can't wait!</button>

            Right, just one more step to connect your wireless device. I recommend scanning this QR code to connect, but you can also follow <a href="#" target="_blank" id="js-connect-link">this link</a>.
            Go ahead, I'll wait.

            Nice! Let's get started. My goodness, isn't this an... interesting universe. Let's see if we can't make our way to the next portal.
            Keep an eye on the signal's ping, the higher it is, the longer it takes for me to receive a command from your console.
            <button type="button" class="js-proceed">Got it</button>

            Yikes! Watch out for those... Y'know, I honestly can't tell what those are. Also, be careful of the static hazards. I'd hate to get disconnected!
